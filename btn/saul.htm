      <h1>Saul</h1>
      <p>The name Saul (or Shaul) comes from the Hebrew word meaning &#8220;asked.&#8221; The name first appears in a list of early Edomite kings (Gen.&nbsp;36:37-38). A clan of
       Simeonites, the Shaulites, is named for Simeon&#x2019;s son, Shaul (Gen.&nbsp;46:10). A Levite was also named Shaul (1&nbsp;Chron.&nbsp;6:24). <span class="word">Shaul</span>
       is simply an alternate spelling for Saul.</p>
      <p>The most well-known Saul in the Old Testament was the first king of Israel. He was a Benjamite. Most references to him are found in 1 &amp; 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles. He is
       also mentioned in the traditional headings of five psalms (18, 52, 54, 57, 59), in a sermon in Acts&nbsp;13:21, and in a reference to his birthplace in Isaiah&nbsp;10:29.</p>
      <p>King Saul was set up for success, but a series of sins ended his dynasty and, eventually, his life (1&nbsp;Sam.&nbsp;13:5-14; 15:1-35; 28:4-19; 31:1-6). He reigned forty years,
       from about 1050 to 1010 BC (Acts&nbsp;13:21).</p>
      <h1>Paul</h1>
      <p>Acts introduces us to another Benjamite named Saul, a Pharisee who zealously persecuted the church (Acts&nbsp;7:58-8:3; Php.&nbsp;3:5-6). He was chosen to be an apostle by a direct
       vision from Jesus, and he wrote thirteen of the New Testament letters (Acts&nbsp;9:1-18). As a Christian, he used his zeal to spread the good news of salvation throughout the world.</p>
      <p>The apostle Saul&#x2019;s story is, in a way, King Saul&#x2019;s story in reverse. King Saul started off fighting the enemies of God&#x2019;s people but later turned against
       God&#x2019;s next anointed king and spiraled into sin. The apostle began fighting against God&#x2019;s Anointed King and His disciples but later repented and became a disciple
       himself. It&#x2019;s interesting that both men were Benjamites named Saul.</p>
      <p>Saul also had a Roman (Latin) name: Paulus<sup>1</sup>. In Acts&nbsp;13:9, Luke begins referring to Saul by his Roman name. The shift may have been due to his work among
       Hellenistic Jews<sup>2</sup> and Gentiles. Paul also had Roman citizenship, which provided certain rights (Acts&nbsp;16:37; 22:23-29). Paulus means &#8220;small.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Another person with this name was Sergius Paulus, governor of Cyprus (Acts&nbsp;13:7).</p><br>
      <p class="fn"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnotes:</span><br>
       <sup>1</sup> English translations often remove the <span class="word">us</span> or <span class="word">os</span> from the end of Latin and Greek names (Timotheos, Markus).<br>
       <sup>2</sup> Hellenistic Jews refers to Jews who normally spoke Greek or Jews of the Dispersion (those living outside of Palestine). Hellenism was adoption of Greek culture and
        language. In Judea, Hellenism was controversial (Acts&nbsp;6:1). Outside of Judea, Jews were generally Hellenistic.</p><br>

      <p class="scr">While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &#8220;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221;&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;13:2</span></p>
