      <h1>Immanuel</h1>
      <p>Immanuel is a Hebrew name meaning &#8220;God With Us.&#8221; The Greek spelling is Emmanuel.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, God had fellowship with humans. That fellowship was broken by sin. To heal that separation, God returned.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Genesis&nbsp;3:8; Isaiah&nbsp;59:1-2; John&nbsp;1:14</span></p>
      <p>About 735 BC, God foretold the birth of a son named Immanuel to a virgin. Matthew cited the birth of Jesus to Mary, a virgin, as its fulfillment. Immanuel is what
       we think of as a nickname, ascribed to Jesus to describe something he would accomplish.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14; Matthew&nbsp;1:18-25</span></p>
      <p>Immanuel is significant in two ways. (1) God the Son came in the flesh to literally walk among humans. (2) God came to restore fellowship, which is often represented
       by the picture of two walking together.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Genesis&nbsp;6:9; 2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</span></p>
      <p>As Matthew opens with the birth of the one called &#8220;God With Us,&#8221; it closes with Jesus&#x2019; promise, &#8220;I am with you always, to the end of the
       age.&#8221;&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</span></p>
      <p class="scr">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: &#8220;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel&#8221;
       (which means, God with us).&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;1:22-23</span></p>
