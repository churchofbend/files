      <h1>Simon Peter Cephas</h1>
      <p>One reason multiple names are given for some people in the New Testament was that three cultures were prevalent at that time, and each had its own language. Greek was a
       nearly universal language, much like English is today. Latin was the language of Rome, more prevalent in the Western Empire and used in official government business.
       People also spoke the native tongue of their own ethnic culture. For Jews, this was Aramaic. Another reason for multiple names is nicknames.</p>
      <p>The apostle we know best as Peter was named Simon<sup>a</sup> by his parents. This is an alternate spelling of Simeon<sup>b</sup>, one of the tribes of Israel. Simeon
       meant &#8220;Hear.&#8221; This was his Jewish name. Jesus gave him his nickname, Cephas<sup>c</sup>, which meant &#8220;Rock&#8221; in Aramaic. We know him better by the
       Greek equivalent, Peter (from Petros<sup>d</sup>).&nbsp; <span class="thr">&nbsp; Genesis&nbsp;29:33; John&nbsp;1:42; Mark&nbsp;3:16</span></p>
      <p>Jesus used Peter&#x2019;s nickname, &#8220;The Rock,&#8221; in a play on words when Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God,
       which is the foundational truth upon which Jesus built his church.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;16:13-18</span></p>
      <p>Jesus also called him &#8220;Simon bar-Jonah,&#8221; which simply means Simon, son of Jonah (or John).&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;16:17; John&nbsp;1:42</span></p>
      <p>There were many men named Simon in the New Testament, but the nicknames Cephas and Peter are unique to the apostle.</p>
      <p class="fn"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hebrew/Greek Pronunciations:</span><br>
       <sup>a</sup> Simon = See-mown<br>
       <sup>b</sup> Simeon = Shim-own<br>
       <sup>c</sup> Cephas = Kay-foss<br>
       <sup>d</sup> Petros = Pet-ross</p>
      <p class="scr">Jesus looked at him and said, &#8220;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas&#8221; (which is translated Peter).&nbsp; <span class="thr">John&nbsp;1:42</span></p>
