      <h1>Golgotha</h1>
      <p>Golgotha is the site where Jesus was crucified. Matthew, Mark, and John provide the name in Aramaic (<span class="word">Golgotha</span>) and Greek (<span class="word">Kranion</span>),
       which is translated Skull in English (Matt.&nbsp;27:33; Mark&nbsp;15:22; John&nbsp;19:17). Luke only has the Greek, which the KJV renders as the Latin, <span class="word">Calvary</span> (Luke&nbsp;23:33).</p>
      <p>Both the location and story behind the name are unknown today, though many speculations exist. The site was near Jerusalem but outside its gates (John&nbsp;19:20; Heb.&nbsp;13:12).
       It is often assumed to be a hill, possibly due to its name, but there is no historical or Scriptural evidence for that.</p>
      <p>Golgotha is not referred to in the Old Testament.</p>
      <p class="scr">So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him,
       and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. &nbsp; <span class="thr">John&nbsp;19:17-18</span></p><br>
