      <h1>Laodicea</h1>
      <p>Three cities mentioned in the Bible were clustered along the Lycus River Valley in the Roman province of Asia: Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis. The churches there were probably
       established on Paul&#x2019;s third preaching trip (Acts&nbsp;19:10), although Paul had probably not personally been to all of these places (Col.&nbsp;4:12-17;&nbsp;2:1).</p>
      <p>Paul wrote at least three letters to the Lycus River Valley churches: Colossians, Philemon, and a letter to the Laodiceans (Col.&nbsp;4:16)<sup>1</sup>. The letters were carried
       by Tychicus, who was accompanied by Onesimus (Philemon&nbsp;1:10-12; Col.&nbsp;4:7-9). Part of John&#x2019;s Revelation was addressed directly to Laodicea
       (Rev.&nbsp;1:11;&nbsp;3:14-22). We also know of saints in Hierapolis from the Colossian letter (Col.&nbsp;4:13).</p>
      <p>By the end of the first century, the church in Laodicea needed correction. Jesus used local imagery to portray their spiritual condition. Laodicea was one of the wealthiest
       cities in the world. While the Christians there enjoyed great earthly prosperity, they were spiritually lacking. Each item related to Laodicea&#x2019;s commerce:<br>
       <ul>
        <li>&#8220;Purified gold&#8221; drew from the city&#x2019;s renown wealth
        <li>&#8220;White garments&#8221; drew from its soft wool used in clothing
        <li>&#8220;Eye salve&#8221; drew from the eye medicine developed by a doctor there
       </ul></p>
      <p>The water sitiuation there provided an even more vivid illustration. Just a few miles up the road, Colossae enjoyed refreshing cold water. Just across the valley, Hierapolis
       was famous for its hot springs and pools, which were thought to have medicinal benefits. Laodicea, however, had to pipe in its water, making it lukewarm and disgusting. The
       spiritual state of the church there was like the city&#x2019;s water, and Jesus was ready to spew them out, much like a visitor might do after taking a sip of water there.
       When Jesus expressed his desire that the Laodiceans be &#8220;hot&#8221; or &#8220;cold,&#8221; he was encouraging them to imitate the nearby faithful examples in Hierapolis (hot)
       and Colossae (cold). We may infer, from the absence of specific sins and the instruction to be zealous, that the Laodicean church had simply lost its enthusiasm for serving God.
       Thus, &#8220;lukewarm&#8221; is a metaphor for apathetic.</p>
      <p>For further reading, I recommend <a href="https://padfield.com/acrobat/history/laodicea.pdf">Colosse, Hierapolis, and Laodicea</a> by David Padfield.</p><br>
      <p class="scr">&#8220;To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:<br> &#x2018;The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.<br>
       I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
       For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by
       fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may
       see. Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to
       him and eat with him, and he with me. The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. He who has
       an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&#x2019;&#8221;&nbsp; <span class="thr">Revelation&nbsp;3:14-22</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnotes:</span></p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>1</sup> Philemon probably hosted the church in Colossae. Some believe he hosted the church in Laodicea and that the &#8220;letter to the Laodiceans&#8221;
       was the one we call Philemon.</p>
