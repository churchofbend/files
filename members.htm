      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Jesus said, &#8220;I will build my church&#8221; (Matthew 16:18), and Paul wrote, &#8220;Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its
       Savior&#8221; (Ephesians 5:23). Our goal is to be that church that Jesus built by following the instructions in God&#x2019;s word.</p>
      <p>We meet every Sunday to remember the Lord&#x2019;s sacrifice, sing, pray, study, and give.
       We also meet on Wednesday evenings to sing, pray, and study. The first Wednesday of each month is dedicated to singing.</p>
      <p>We&#x2019;d love to see you at one of our assemblies, or you can contact us through this site, email, or Facebook Messenger.
       We&#x2019;re happy to answer your questions about God&#x2019;s gift of salvation and the church that meets here.</p><br>
