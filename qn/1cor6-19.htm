      <h1>1 Corinthians 6:19</h1>
      <p class="scr">Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price.
       So glorify God in your body. <span class="thr">1 Cor. 6:19-20 ESV</span></p>
      <p>This metaphor is often quoted out of context. To apply it properly, read the entire section (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;6:12-20).</p>
      <p>To sin against a temple<sup>1</sup> was unthinkable, for both Jews and pagans. Likewise, sinning against one&#x2019;s own body should be unthinkable.</p>
      <p>Corinth was famous for the sexual immorality<sup>2</sup> practiced by its residents<sup>3</sup>. Temple prostitution was also part of the Greco-Roman religion. This was a sin that threatened to
       revive within the lives of the Christians there, though they had largely overcome it (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;6:9-11). Some in the church there had not completely accepted that
       it&#x2019;s sinful and tried to rationalize that the body is designed for sex, just like the stomach is designed for food. So, how could using the body for sex ever be wrong? Paul
       noted that the body&#x2019;s purpose is not for sex but for serving God. He addressed the proper way in which to fulfill sexual desires in the next section, but here we find a
       strong condemnation of sexual immorality.</p>
      <p>Although this verse is often misapplied to various practices (tattoos, body piercings, smoking, and poor diet and exercise), Paul specified that the temple metaphor applied
       here to one specific sin. In fact, he explicitly singles out this sin and puts it in its own category. Sexual immorality is the one sin that is committed against one&#x2019;s own body.</p>
      <p>Sexual temptation is strong. Paul said, &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality.&#8221; Don&#x2019;t underestimate its draw or overestimate your strength. Just get away from any opportunity,
       like Joseph did (Gen.&nbsp;39:12).</p><br>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnotes:</span></p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>1</sup> The most obvious way to sin against a temple is desecration - violating its holiness. Sins against the Israelite temple included entrance by an
       anauthorized person, using the altar for sacrifices to idols, or using the utensils and furniture for common activities. The Greek ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated
       the temple with the blood of a pig - an unclean animal. Emperor Caligula intended to place a statue of himself in the temple but failed.</p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>2</sup> Sexual immorality is from the Greek word <span class="word">porneia</span>. It included all forms of unlawful sexual intercourse (adultery,
       homosexuality, sex before marriage, incest, prostitution, bestiality).</p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>3</sup> To <span class="word">Corinthianize</span> meant to engage in sexual immorality. The term was derived from the city&#x2019;s reputation.</p><br>
