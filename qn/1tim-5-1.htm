      <h1>1 Timothy 5:1-2</h1>
      <p class="scr">Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity. <span class="thr">ESV</span></p>
      <p>A common misunderstanding comes from the problematic word *rebuke*, which is found in many translations. While *rebuke* is a common word in our English Bibles, the Greek word here is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. This one literally means *to beat on*. A few translations render it *rebuke sharply* (NASB), *speak angrily to* (NCV), or *speak harshly to* (NET, ISV, NRSVue, NLT). <span class="thr">*VERSES*</span></p>
      <p>This prohibits viscious verbal attack, not respectful rebuke. From the contrasting command to appeal to (or exhort) him as a father, it*s clear that correction of some error is in view. Someone, especially a younger person, may be tempted to address the situation emotionally and abrasively, which is disrespectful and also unhelpful. <span class="thr">*VERSES*</span></p>
      <p>Also note that the term rendered *elder* in the ASV and KJV does not refer to the role in the church. Although this is the Greek word used for that role, it can refer simply to an older man. Given that the other references in the text emphasize age, *older man* is the correct meaning here and is found in almost all other translations. <span class="thr">*VERSES*</span></p>
