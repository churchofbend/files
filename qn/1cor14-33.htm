      <h1>1 Corinthians 14:33</h1>
      <p class="scr">For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints...&nbsp; <span class="thr">ESV</span><br>
       For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.&nbsp; <span class="thr">KJV</span></p>
      <p>In the context, the assemblies in Corinth had devolved into chaos due to people misusing their various gifts. People were speaking over each other, and multiple things were happening simultaneously, so that the church was not being built up in its worship. In contrast to this chaos, God expects the assemblies of his people to orderly and peaceful, for the benefit of both members and outsiders. This text is sometimes misunderstood to be teaching that God has made his word understandable as opposed to confusing, perhaps due to the word &#8220;author&#8221; being added in translation<sup>1</sup>. The context is referring to the assembly, not to the word.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnotes:</span></p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>1</sup> The Greek literally reads: &#8220;God is not of confusion.&#8221; The second noun is implied, but it is needed for clarity in English. Most translators have added &#8220;a God,&#8221; while some have added &#8220;the author.&#8221;</p>
