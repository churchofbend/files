      <h1>Christ</h1>
      <p>Christ is derived from the Greek <span class="word">christos</span>, which means <span class="word">anointed one</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="word">messiah</span>.&nbsp; <span class="thr">John&nbsp;1:41;&nbsp;4:25</span></p>
      <p>Anointing was the inauguration process by which kings, priests, and prophets were appointed to their offices. Oil was poured on his head and his appointment was formally announced.&nbsp; <span class="thr">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:16; Exodus&nbsp;28:41; 1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;10:1</span></p>
      <p>The Anointed One was prophesied and greatly anticipated by the Jews.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Psalm&nbsp;2; Isaiah&nbsp;61:1-3; Daniel&nbsp;9:24-27</span></p>
      <p>He would be King, Prophet, and High Priest.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;21:5; Acts&nbsp;3:22; Hebrews&nbsp;4:14</span></p>
      <p>Jesus&#x2019; anointing occurred immediately after his baptism. He was anointed with the Holy Spirit rather than with oil, and the Father made the announcement.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;3:16-17; Mark&nbsp;1:9-11; Luke&nbsp;3:21-22; John&nbsp;1:32-33; Acts&nbsp;10:38</span></p>
      <p class="scr">When Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.&#8221;&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;3:16-17</span></p>
