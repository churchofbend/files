      <h1>Exhort</h1>
      <p>Exhortation has three basic meanings in the Bible:</p>
      <p>1. <span class="word">A call to come to one&#x2019;s side</span> is the literal meaning. Today, we would use the phrase &#8220;get on board&#8221; to convey the same idea. When this meaning is intended, the phrase <span class="word">I urge you...</span> is a common translation, as well as <span class="word">encourage</span>, <span class="word">beseech</span>, <span class="word">implore</span>, <span class="word">appeal</span>, and <span class="word">entreat</span>. A sense of urgency and importance is implied. Peter exhorted the crowd on Pentecost to obey. Paul exhorted the divided church in Corinth to agree.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts 2:40; 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</span><br>
      <p>2. <span class="word">Encouragement to continue</span> is an exhortation to someone who is already on your side. Barnabas and Paul visited Christians in various places, exhorting them to continue in the faith. In fact, Barnabas means <span class="word">Son of Exhortation</span>.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;11:23; Acts&nbsp;14:22; Acts&nbsp;4:36</span><br>
      <p>3. <span class="word">A message of comfort</span> is also called exhortation. Paul provided reassuring information about the second coming to the distressed Christians in Thessalonica, telling them to <span class="word">comfort one another</span> with his words. The church in Corinth needed to comfort a recently restored brother.&nbsp; <span class="thr">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:18; 2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6-8</span></p>
      <p>Exhort and exhortation are very common words in the New Testament, and we should be frequently exhorting one another in whatever way is needed. Be like Barnabas.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Hebrews&nbsp;3:13; Romans&nbsp;12:1; 1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:11</span></p>
      <p class="scr">I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, exhort you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called. With all humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another in love, be eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Ephesians&nbsp;4:1-3</span></p>
