      <h1>Baptism</h1>
      <p>Baptism and baptize are derived from the Greek words <span class="word">baptisma</span> and <span class="word">baptizo</span>, respectively. Baptism means immersion or submersion.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;8:38; John&nbsp;3:23</span></p>
      <p>In Acts 2 and Acts 10, a group of Jews and a group of Gentiles received a special baptism of the Holy Spirit to fulfill the prophecy of Joel and the promise of Jesus to his apostles. Baptism is also used in a special, figurative way in 1 Corinthians 10 to describe the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea. Baptism in water, as seen throughout Acts, is the only baptism related to salvation.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;1:4-5; Acts&nbsp;2:1-21; Acts&nbsp;11:15-17; 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1-2; Ephesians&nbsp;4:4-6</span></p>
      <p>The common usage of baptism is illustrated in a Greek recipe from 200 BC for making pickles: Baptize (<span class="word">baptizo</span>) the cucumber in vinegar. The vegetable is permanently changed, just as the person who is baptized in water.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Romans&nbsp;6</span></p>
      <p>Baptism is how one &#8220;calls upon the name of the Lord&#8221; to receive salvation. It is how we appeal to God to cleanse the conscience. Baptism symbolizes washing away sins and death, burial, and resurrection.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;2:21,&nbsp;38; 1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:21; Acts&nbsp;22:16; Romans&nbsp;6:3-4</span></p>
      <p>At baptism, one becomes a disciple of Jesus and is added to God&#x2019;s church.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;28:19; 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:13; Acts&nbsp;2:41; Galatians&nbsp;3:27-28</span></p>
      <p>The New Testament uniformly affirms that baptism is a prerequisite to salvation. It is not the work which provides salvation; it is the condition which those seeking salvation must fulfill to receive it.&nbsp; <span class="thr">Mark&nbsp;16:16; 1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:21</span></p>
      <p class="scr">&#8220;Now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.&#8221;&nbsp; <span class="thr">Acts&nbsp;22:16</span></p>
