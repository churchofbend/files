      <h1>Hell</h1>
      <p>Hell is the English word for the eternal fate of the condemned. It does not come directly from any Biblical words.</p>
      <p>The KJV translates four different words as &#8220;hell.&#8221; The first two are <span class="word">sheol</span> (Hebrew) and <span class="word">hades</span> (Greek)
       (Psa.&nbsp;16:10; Acts&nbsp;2:27-32). These words refer to the realm of the dead, pre-resurrection and pre-final-judgment. Sometimes, they are used somewhat figuratively to
       indicate punishment or death, but never do they refer to post-judgment eternal suffering (Matt.&nbsp;11:23;&nbsp;16:18). A few other translations randomly translate these words
       as &#8220;hell&#8221; in some places. The third and fourth are the Greek words <span class="word">gehenna</span> and <span class="word">tartarus</span>
       (James&nbsp;3:6; 2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:4).</p>
      <p>In the Old Testament, no one term exists for the concept of hell. Many of the warnings primarily concern earthly consequences, although both the New Testament and the Apocrypha
       demonstrate that the people of that time were aware of reward and punishment beyond this world (Heb.&nbsp;11:13-16; 1&nbsp;Enoch&nbsp;27:1-3; 2&nbsp;Esdras&nbsp;7:36<sup>1</sup>).
       Jesus provided the most teaching on hell found in the Bible. He used the term <span class="word">gehenna</span>, which is Greek for Valley of Hinnom. This valley had a history
       that made it a fitting picture of eternal punishment. It was located by Jerusalem. In Judah&#x2019;s idolatrous days, Topheth, a place of child sacrifice, was located in this
       valley  (2&nbsp;Chron.&nbsp;28:3;&nbsp;33:6; Jer.&nbsp;32:35). King Josiah defiled it in his reforms (2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:10). Jeremiah gave it the prophetic name &#8220;Valley
       of Slaughter&#8221; to signify God&#x2019;s punishment (Jer.&nbsp;7:31-32;&nbsp;19:1-15). It eventually became a city dump for trash, waste, and bodies of criminals and animals.
       This gave rise to the combined concepts of the undying worm and unceasing fire, which Isaiah and Jesus used (Isa.&nbsp;66:24; Mark&nbsp;9:43-48). To the Jew it was a place of
       evil, uncleanness, and death.</p>
      <p><span class="word">Tartarus</span> is only found in 2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:4 in verb form (meaning to cast down to Tartarus). In Greek mythology, Tartarus was a deep, dark
       dungeon for wicked souls in the lower parts of the underworld. Peter described it as the place God cast the angels who sinned. It may correlate to the prison in Hades where the
       souls of the wicked are tormented (pre-judgment), or it may refer to what we think of as hell (post-judgment) (1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:19-20; Luke&nbsp;16:19-26). The context and
       wording here suggest a pre-judgment torment (see also Jude&nbsp;1:6).</p>
      <p>Hell is described as the second death (Rev.&nbsp;21:8). Death is a separation. The first death is physical&#8211; separation of body and soul. The second is spiritual&#8211; separation
       between one&#x2019;s soul and God (Rom.&nbsp;6:23). It&#x2019;s described as a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, showing sorrow and anger, respectively (Matt.&nbsp;13:36-43).
       Jesus called it the darkness outside, which alluded to being kicked out of an evening party onto the dark, dangerous streets (Matt.&nbsp;22:1-14). It is described as a conscious,
       painful punishment (Matt.&nbsp;26:46; 2&nbsp;Thess.&nbsp;1:9). It is pictured as a lake of fire, an image which strikes terror in the heart (Rev.&nbsp;20:15). It is the place where
       Satan, his angels, and all the wicked will be cast (Rev.&nbsp;20:10; Matt.&nbsp;25:41). Satan will not rule in hell. He will be among the tortured inmates there. Every description
       in the Bible portrays a place which no one wants to be.</p>
      <p>Note that the word &#8220;hell&#8221; in hymns and other religious material sometimes refers to death or the realm of the dead, following the broader historical usage and the
       popular KJV translation. The context clearly qualifies the meaning in most cases.</p><br>

      <p class="scr">&#8220;Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.&#8221;&nbsp;
       <span class="thr">Matthew&nbsp;10:28&nbsp;ESV</span></p><br>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnotes:</span></p>
      <p class="fn"><sup>1</sup> Apocryphal books are not inspired and contain many myths and errors. The purpose of citing them is to show that Jews believed in consequences beyond
       this world, even apart from Jesus&#x2019; teaching.</p><br>
